# Speech-based Chatbot

**Welcome to Speech-Chatbot!** This is an dvising speech-based chatbot developed by using a deep learning model to support high school students. The corpus in this study is created from 1791 pairs of questions and answers. The model is designed by using the encoder-decoder (Seq2Seq). An embedding layer is added to the LSTM layer. Finally a single dense layer with Softmax function is connected in this model to generate the response.


**This mode is designed as following**

```python
import seq2seq
